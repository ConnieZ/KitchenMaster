# KitchenMaster
Kitchen Master is an Android App that stores a list of your kitchen items and helps easily prepare a shopping list. I developed it as my final project for the online CS50 course on edX.org.  

Demo of the App on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTTrSI9vYFw

The app was built on the basis of a Google Notepad App provided as part of sample exercises. 

## Current Status

Undergoing migration from Eclipse to Android Studio. Some backward incompatibility was identified. 

## New features coming

- Searching for items

## Bug fixes coming

 - In ShoppingList view the "Bought" button hides the bottom item on the list.
